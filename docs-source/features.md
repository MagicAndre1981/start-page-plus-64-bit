## Recent Items

The *Recent Items* list brings back the ability to filter the list of recent items,
and the grouping by timeframe that we had in VS 2017.

### Collapsible Timeframes

Each timeframe group can be collapsed or expanded by clicking anywhere on the group name.
This can come in handy if you want to view items that are currently not being displayed
without having to scroll all the way down.

When you select the number of items to display, you'll need to click the *Refresh* link to see
the change.
It's also a quick way to expand all of the timeframe groups at once.

#### Settings

Clicking on the *Settings* link will open the `Tools` | `Options` | `Start Page+` | `Recent Items`
settings page without having to navigate through the dropdowns.

## Get Started

The *Get Started* list gives new users a simplified way to get to their code, the same as in VS 2019's
*Start Window*. Plus a few extras.

![Start Items](assets/images/get-started.png)

### Clone Or Checkout Code

Quickly get code from an online repository by entering the repository location.
You can also browse GitHub or Azure DevOps repositories from here,
which will take you to the *Connect* dialog.

### Open A Local Folder

Open any folder on your local machine, or on a network share.
Here *local* basically just means '*not in the cloud*'.

### Open A Project Or Solution

A quick way to get to the *Open Project/Solution* dialog without having to use `File` | `Open` | `Project/Solution`.

### Create A New Project

A quick way to get to the *New Project* dialog without having to use `File` | `New` | `Project`.

### Restart Visual Studio

Any time you need to restart Visual Studio you can do it from the *Start Page+* window in just one click.
No need to close and re-open Visual Studio manually.

### Restart As Administrator

You can also restart Visual Studio as Administrator without having to you through the hassle of finding
and right-clcking a Visual Studio shortcut etc.

Note: if you launch Visual Studio as Administrator, you can't get back to a non-elevated session by
clicking on *Restart Visual Studio*.
There doesn't seem to be a programmatic way to force an elevated session to restart as a normal session.

### Links

#### Changelog

With just a single-click you can see what's changed in the new version of *Start Page+*.

#### Version Number

This is a subtle way of being able to see the version number of the currently installed version of
*Start Page+*.

Clicking on the version number will open the website's Overview page.
On there you can see what the latest available version of *Start Page+* is at the top of the page.

#### Options

having to use `Tools` | `Options` | `Start Page+`.

## Developer News

The *Developer News* feed brings back VS 2017's handy list of Microsoft developer-related news items that was removed from
VS 2019.
I don't know how many times I've seen something that interests me that I might have missed if I hadn't seen it on my
start page.

![Developer News](assets/images/developer-news.png)

### Items Feed Url

By default the feed url is set to the url of the original *Developer News* that used to be in Visual Studio 2017.
Microsoft is currently still maintaining that feed, but could stop doing so at any time.
You could choose to use the *Visual Studio Blog* feed url instead if you wanted.

In the past the two feeds have displayed a different set of posts,
with Visual Studio Blog having more posts that the Developer News feed.
But it seems that may currently have the same items.

The *Visual Studio Blog* feed url is `https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/feed`.

### Items to Display

You can choose the number of items that are displayed in the list.

There are only 10 items in the orginal feed, and Microsoft replaces older posts with new ones.
If you set a feed url to something that has a lerger number of items you might want to limit
how many are downloaded and displayed.

### Open Items in VS

By default the items open right in VS itself, rather than switching to the default browser.
Personally, I prefer having to switch applications as little as possible.
When I'm working in Visual Studio, I prefer to stay in Visual Studio, and not have my attention derailed by having
to switch to a different application, and then back again to Visual Studio.

However, for those people who prefer links to be opened in their default browser,
there's an option to change *Start Page+*'s behavior to do just that.

### Links

![Recent Items](assets/images/links-developer-news.png)

#### Refresh

There is currently no auto-refresh for *Developer News*, so you'll have to click *Refresh* to
check if you have the latest available news items from Microsoft.

Also, when you select the number of items to display, you'll need to click the *Refresh* link
to see the change.

#### Settings

Clicking on the *Settings* link will open the `Tools` | `Options` | `Start Page+` | `Developer News`
settings page without having to navigate through the dropdowns.
