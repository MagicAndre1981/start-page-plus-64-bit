Microsoft didn't make it easy to have a 32-bit & 64-bit extension be able to be
**_written once and run in both_**, so this new 64-bit version will ONLY run in 
**VS 2022 or higher**.

To use *Start Page+ 1.x* in VSS 2017 or 2019, plese refer to 
the original [Start Page+ (32-bit)][start-page-plus-32-bit-url] website.
