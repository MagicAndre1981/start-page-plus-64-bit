# Goals for Start Page+

I've tried to capture the pain points, features, requests, feedback etc that have come out of the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/search.html?f=&type=question+OR+problem+OR+idea&type=question+OR+problem+OR+idea&c=&redirect=search%2Fsearch&sort=relevance&q=start+page) posts listed below.
