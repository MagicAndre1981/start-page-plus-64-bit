## Bring Back Start Page!

When Visual Studio 2019 was released, many developers were dismayed to find that the _Start **Page**_
had been completely replaced by a new _Start **Window**_ (a big **modal** dialog window,
with no _Developer News_).

![Start Window](assets/images/start-window-light.png)

## Introducing Start Page+

So many of you, in **so many posts** in the [Developer Community forum][developer-community-forum-url], **pleaded** for Microsoft to bring back the Visual Studio 2017
_Start Page_, and unfortunately those pleas fell on deaf ears.

[developer-community-forum-url]: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/search.html?f=&type=question+OR+problem+OR+idea&type=question+OR+problem+OR+idea&c=&redirect=search%2Fsearch&sort=relevance&q=start+page

Well, you asked for it, and now _Start Page+_ delivers it. All that was taken away,
**plus** more! (get it?)

![Start Window](assets/images/start-page-plus.png)

[Start Page+][start-page-plus-url] is a start page replacement
that is a **dockable tool window**, not a **modal window**.
It's been written **from the ground up**, and doesn't rely on any of Visual Studio's *internal* code.
So it can't be taken  away by Microsoft. And it's open source!

For a complete list of *Start Page+*'s features, including images, [click here][features-url] to go to
the *Features* page on the *Start Page+* website.

### To Open The Start Page+ Window

- make sure Visual Studio's *Start Window* is disabled
    - in **Tools** | **Options** | **Environment** | **Startup** select _Empty Environment_

    ![Startup Options](assets/images/startup-options.png)

- click on **View** | **Start Page+**

The _Start Page+_ window is accessed from the **View** menu, because it just *makes sense*.
It's also easy to remember because you think "*I want to **view** the start page*",
you don't think "*I want to **file** the start page*".

The Visual Studio 2010-2017's _Start Page_ was always in the **View** menu,
until Microsoft moved it to the **File** menu in later versions of VS 2017,
and then permanently in VS 2019, which never really made **any** sense to me.

### Custom Themes

*Start Page+* will use colors from any custom theme.

#### Dark Purple

This is my custom *Dark Purple* theme, based on the built-in *Dark* theme.

![Dark Purple](assets/images/themes/custom/dark-purple.png)

#### Original Blue Theme (from VS 2017)

Mads Kristensen wrote an extension called [Original Blue Theme][original-blue-theme-extension]
to bring back the original theme from VS 2017.

### Color Theme Editor Themes

The [Color Theme Editor for Visual Studio 2019][color-theme-editor-extension]
extension adds more themes to choose from, and lets you create your own themes (which is what I did).
However Microsoft has now marked it *deprecated*, advising users to use
[Visual Studio Color Theme Designer][vs-color-theme-designer-extension] instead.
However I've found it extremely frustrating, and had no success creating a decent custom theme.
