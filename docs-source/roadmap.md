## Feature Ideas

New feature ideas will be added to the GitHub repo's [Issues page][github-issues].
If you have an idea for a new feature, please check the page to see if your idea has already been added.

If not, please feel free to [add an issue][new-github-issue] for your idea, and we can discuss it.

## Contributions

If you'd like to implement one of the _feature ideas_ already listed on the [Issues page][github-issues],
feel free to add a comment in the issue.

We can then work toward developing a pull request,
so your work can be incorporated into _Start Page+_ and made available for everyone to benefit from.
